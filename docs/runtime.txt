harec expects the runtime to provide some features under the "rt" namespace.

@noreturn @symbol("rt.abort") fn _abort(msg: str) void;
	Print a diagnostic message and terminate the program.

@noreturn fn abort_fixed(reason: int) void;
	Print a diagnostic message from a list of pre-determined abort reasons,
	and terminate the program. The list of reasons are:

	0: Slice or array access out-of-bounds
	1: Type assertion failed
	2: Out of memory
	3: Static append exceeds slice capacity
	4: Unreachable code

fn memcpy(dest: *void, src: *void, n: size) void;
	Copy "n" bytes from "src" to "dest". The memory areas shall not
	overlap.

fn memmove(dest: *void, src: *void, n: size) void;
	Copy "n" bytes from "src" to "dest". The memory areas may overlap.

fn memset(dest: *void, val: u8, n: size) void;
	Set "n" bytes, starting from the address at "dest", to "val".

fn strcmp(a: str, b: str) bool;
	Compare strings "a" and "b", returning true of they are equal.

"ensure" and "unensure" are called when slices are expanded or deleted. The
"length" field of the slice will have been updated, and ensure should allocate
or re-allocate the data field to have sufficient space, and update the capacity
field accordingly. "unensure" is called when the space is no longer needed, and
should shrink the allocation as appropriate.

	type slice = struct {
		data: nullable *void,
		length: size,
		capacity: size,
	};

	fn ensure(s: *slice, membsz: size) void;
	fn unensure(s: *slice, membsz: size) void;

"malloc" and "free" are required to support the "alloc" and "free" built-ins.

	fn malloc(n: size) nullable *void;

	@symbol("rt.free") fn free_(_p: nullable *void) void;

The runtime is also expected to provide startup code. A list of function
pointers of type `fn() void` is provided in the __init_array_start and
__fini_array_start globals, which are respectively terminated by
__init_array_end and __fini_array_end. The following Hare code will make these
globals available to the current unit:

	const @symbol("__init_array_start") init_start: [*]*fn() void;
	const @symbol("__init_array_end") init_end: [*]*fn() void;
	const @symbol("__fini_array_start") fini_start: [*]*fn() void;
	const @symbol("__fini_array_end") fini_end: [*]*fn() void;

The runtime must call each initialization function, then call the `main`
function (of type `fn() void`), then call all of the finalization functions,
before terminating the program normally.

When building with +test (harec -T +test), @test functions will be emitted, and
an ELF section, .test_array, will be populated similarly to init_array. The
startup code can enumerate the available tests like so:

	type test = struct {
		name: str,
		func: *fn() void,
	};

	const @symbol("__test_array_start") test_start: [*]test;
	const @symbol("__test_array_end") test_end: [*]test;

In order to use these symbols, a custom linker script must be used. A sample is
provided in rt/hare.sc which is compatible with GNU's ld and LLVM's lld.

It is expected that, when built in +test mode, the runtime will execute these
test functions instead of calling main. Under these conditions, the runtime is
still expected to call the @init and @fini functions as well, respectively
before and after running the tests.
